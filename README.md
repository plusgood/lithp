#Lithp

##Overview
- There are essentially only two things in the language:
    - Creating an anonymous function
    - Calling a function
- The entire language is fully parenthesized
- A program consists of a single expression
- Code compiles to C++

##Benefits
- Simple to learn and implement
- Fun (challenging) to use

##TODO
- Partial function application
- Lists and list operations (map, folds, etc.)
